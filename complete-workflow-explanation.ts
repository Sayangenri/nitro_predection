🏆 COMPLETE PREDICTION MARKET WORKFLOW
=====================================
Market Question: "Will Portugal win the 2026 World Cup?"

📋 PHASE 1: MARKET CREATION & SETUP
==================================

1️⃣ SMART CONTRACT DEPLOYMENT
   - Deploy PredictionMarket.sol to blockchain (Sepolia/Polygon Amoy)
   - Deploy MockWETH.sol as collateral token
   - Set market parameters:
     * Question: "Will Portugal win 2026 World Cup?"
     * Collateral: WETH tokens
     * Initial liquidity: 100 YES shares, 100 NO shares
     * Fee: 0.5% on all trades
     * Resolution deadline: After World Cup final (July 2026)
     * Admin/Oracle: Multisig wallet for resolution

2️⃣ INITIAL STATE
   - qYes = 100 shares (50% implied probability)
   - qNo = 100 shares (50% implied probability)
   - Total volume = 0 WETH
   - Dynamic B parameter = 100 (base liquidity)

📋 PHASE 2: TRADING PERIOD (2024-2026)
====================================

🎯 TRADITIONAL APPROACH (Direct Smart Contract):

1️⃣ USER WANTS TO BUY YES SHARES
   Step 1: User has WETH tokens
   Step 2: User calls approve(PredictionMarket, amount)
   Step 3: User calls buyYes(amount, minShares)
   
   LMSR Calculation:
   - Current price = qYes / (qYes + qNo)
   - Shares received based on logarithmic formula
   - 0.5% fee deducted
   - User's sharesYes[address] updated
   - Market state updated (qYes, volume, txCount)

2️⃣ USER WANTS TO BUY NO SHARES
   Same process but calls buyNo(amount, minShares)

3️⃣ PRICE DISCOVERY
   - More YES buying → YES price increases, NO price decreases
   - More NO buying → NO price increases, YES price decreases
   - Dynamic B parameter increases with volume (more liquidity)

🌟 YELLOW NETWORK APPROACH (P2P + Settlement):

1️⃣ BROKER SETUP
   - Users become brokers or connect to brokers
   - Brokers authenticate with Yellow ClearNode
   - Brokers deposit collateral to Yellow custody contract
   - State channels opened between brokers

2️⃣ P2P TRADING (OFF-CHAIN)
   - Alice wants YES, Bob wants NO
   - Trade negotiated through Yellow Network messaging
   - LMSR pricing calculated off-chain
   - Trade executed in state channel (instant, no gas)
   - Both parties sign trade messages

3️⃣ SETTLEMENT (ON-CHAIN)
   - Periodic batching of P2P trades
   - Yellow Adjudicator aggregates state changes
   - Single transaction updates PredictionMarket contract
   - Final shares allocated to users

📋 PHASE 3: MARKET RESOLUTION (July 2026)
========================================

1️⃣ WORLD CUP FINAL HAPPENS
   - Real-world event occurs
   - Portugal either wins or doesn't win

2️⃣ ORACLE RESOLUTION (48-hour challenge period)
   Step 1: Admin calls proposeResolution(true/false)
   Step 2: 48-hour challenge window opens
   Step 3: If no valid challenges, resolution finalizes
   Step 4: If challenged, multisig votes on correct outcome

3️⃣ MARKET FINALIZATION
   - If Portugal wins: YES = 1 WETH, NO = 0 WETH
   - If Portugal loses: YES = 0 WETH, NO = 1 WETH
   - Users can redeem their shares for final value

📋 PHASE 4: REDEMPTION & PAYOUT
==============================

1️⃣ USERS REDEEM SHARES
   - Winners call redeem() to get WETH
   - Losers get nothing (shares worth 0)
   - Example: If Portugal wins and you hold 10 YES shares → get 10 WETH

2️⃣ FEE COLLECTION
   - Admin calls withdrawFees()
   - Collected fees go to market operator
   - Total fees = 0.5% of all trading volume

📊 CURRENT STATE EXAMPLE
=======================
Based on our real transactions:

Market State:
- Total YES shares: 30.14 (67% probability Portugal wins)
- Total NO shares: 14.84 (33% probability Portugal loses)
- Total volume: 14.925 WETH traded
- Fees collected: 0.075 WETH (0.5% of volume)

Individual Holdings:
- Alice: 0.29 YES shares
- Bob: 0 shares
- Other traders: 29.85 YES shares, 14.84 NO shares

If Portugal wins in 2026:
- Alice gets: 0.29 WETH
- YES holders get: 30.14 WETH total
- NO holders get: 0 WETH

If Portugal loses in 2026:
- Alice gets: 0 WETH
- YES holders get: 0 WETH
- NO holders get: 14.84 WETH total

💰 ECONOMIC INCENTIVES
====================

For Traders:
- Buy YES if you think Portugal will win
- Buy NO if you think Portugal will lose
- Profit = (Final payout - Purchase cost) per share

For Market Makers:
- Earn 0.5% fees on all volume
- Provide liquidity through LMSR mechanism

For Yellow Network Brokers:
- Earn fees on P2P trading
- Provide instant, gas-free trading experience

🔄 LIFECYCLE SUMMARY
===================

1. Market Created → Initial 50/50 odds
2. Trading Period → Odds shift based on sentiment/news
3. Event Occurs → Real outcome determined
4. Resolution → Oracle sets final result
5. Redemption → Winners collect, losers lose
6. Market Closes → Fees distributed

🎯 KEY INNOVATIONS
================

Traditional Prediction Markets:
- Each trade = blockchain transaction
- High gas costs
- Slow execution
- Limited scalability

Yellow Network Integration:
- P2P trading off-chain (instant, free)
- Batch settlement on-chain (efficient)
- State channels for liquidity
- Scalable to millions of trades

This creates a prediction market that combines:
- Decentralized settlement (blockchain security)
- Instant trading (P2P efficiency)
- Fair pricing (LMSR algorithm)
- Real-world resolution (oracle system)
